# checklist

## intro
The use of this is to help software developers write better software and have better habits when working

This was inspired by <a href="https://a.co/d/9DpHQHJ">The Checklist Manifesto</a>, which is a book by Atul Gawande that highlights the power of checklists in improving performance and reducing errors. Gawande argues that even experts can benefit from using checklists to ensure consistency and enhance teamwork. He provides examples from various industries, such as medicine and aviation, to demonstrate how checklists can save lives and improve outcomes. The book emphasizes the importance of simplicity, standardization, and communication in checklist design and implementation. Overall, it advocates for the systematic use of checklists to enhance productivity and safety in complex tasks.

However, you as the developer are responsible for knowing when its time to creativly ignore the checklist and do things differently.
